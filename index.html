				<h4>I'm a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=90477835">product manager</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kcoleman731">developer</a>, and <a href="http://dribbble.com/KevFColeman">aspiring designer</a>. I have a passion for beautiful user interface design, innovative solutions to technical problems, and building software that helps both developers and consumers enrich their lives.</h4>

				<h4>I've been at <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/">Rhapsody</a> for the past 18 months where I work on a bunch of cool stuff including the <a href="http://developer.rhapsody.com">Rhapsody Developer Platform</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhapsody.songmatch">Rhapsody SongMatch</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rhapsody-concerts/id656734271?mt=8">Rhapsody Concerts</A>, and a handful of other products.

				<h4>I do a lot of development work in my spare time as well, moslty on iOS. I've been building a group photo sharing app with <a href="https://github.com/tayhalla">Taylor Halliday</a> for the last 18 Months called <a href="http://www.gatherapp.co">Gather</a>. We'll be launching in March. I handled the majority of the design, information architecture, UX, UI and worked with Tay on native development. I'm also starting to dig into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you can see with this site.</h4> 

				<h4>I founded and run the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-iOS-Developers/">Seattle iOS Developers</a> meetup with Taylor as well. If you live in Seattle and want to chat some iOS goodness, feel free to come join us!</h4>
			
				<h4>Previously I helped launch <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/08/facebook-acquires-storylane/">Storylane</a> (before they got acquired by Facebook), and attempted to launch a startup of my own in New York called <a href="mangiamo/index.html">Mangiamo</a>. We were trying to build a gifting platform for restaurants. I also worked as an interest derivatives broker for Icap.</h4>

				<h4>I'm always interested in meeting new people and hearing about what you are working on. Feel free to shoot me an email at kcoleman731@gmail.com. If you are interested in reading more, I write on <a href="https://medium.com/@KevFColeman">Medium.</a></h4>
